# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

Welcome to the classic **Number Guessing Game** — with a twist of fun and challenge! 😄  
Built in Python, this little terminal game is all about guessing the right number with smart hints along the way.

## 👋 What’s This About?

You’ll guess a randomly generated number — the computer won’t make it easy, though! 😉  
It gives you clues after every guess like:
- “Too low”, “Too high”
- “Very close... just a little off”
- “Almost there!”

But can you guess it **within the allowed attempts**? Let’s find out!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start the game** — just run the Python file.
2. It will ask for your **name**.
3. Then it will ask if you want to **change the difficulty**.
4. Choose from:
   - 🟢 Easy: 10 tries (1–50)
   - 🟡 Medium: 20 tries (1–150)
   - 🔴 Hard: 50 tries (1–500)

> You won’t be told upfront what the range or attempts are. Just trust your instincts — or change the mode! 😄

5. Keep guessing until:
   - ✅ You get it right
   - ❌ You run out of tries

Once the round ends, you can play again. The screen clears only on restart to keep things neat.
